This assignment will challenge your function writing abilities. I'm not going 
to lie, these functions are difficult but well within your reach. I do, however,
want to recognize that not everyone is interested in being a "virtuoso" with 
their function writing. So, there are two options for this week's lab:

- **Option 1:** Complete this lab assignment in search of virtuoso status with
your function writing
- **Option 2:** Complete one of the difficult functions (Exercise 1 or Exercise
2) and complete the "Alternative Lab 6". 

# Setting the Stage

My number one use case for writing functions and iteration / looping is to
perform some exploration or modeling repeatedly for different "tweaked"
versions. For example, our broad goal might be to fit a linear regression model
to our data. However, there are often multiple choices that we have to make in
practice:

- Keep missing values or fill them in (imputation)? 
- Filter out outliers in one or more variables?

We can map these choices to **arguments** in a custom model-fitting function:

- `impute`: TRUE or FALSE
- `remove_outliers`: TRUE or FALSE

A function that implements the analysis and allows for variation in these 
choices:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| label: example-code-to-motivate-function

fit_model <- function(df, impute, remove_outliers, mod) {
    if (impute) {
        df <- some_imputation_function(df)
    }
    
    if (remove_outliers) {
        df <- function_for_removing_outliers(df)
    }
    
    lm(mod, data = df)
}
```

# Helper Functions

**Exercise 1:** Write a function that removes outliers in a dataset. The user
should be able to supply the dataset, the variables to remove outliers from, and
a threshold on the number of SDs away from the mean used to define outliers. 
*Hint 1: You will need to calculate a z-score to filter the values!*
*Hint 2: You might want to consider specifying a default value (e.g., 3) for `sd_thresh`.*

```{r}
#| label: exercise-1

```

## Testing Your Function! 

```{r}
#| label: exercise-1-test
#| error: true

## Testing how your function handles multiple input variables
remove_outliers(diamonds, 
                price, 
                x, 
                y, 
                z)

## Testing how your function handles an input that isn't numeric
remove_outliers(diamonds, 
                price, 
                color)

## Testing how your function handles a non-default sd_thresh
remove_outliers(diamonds, 
                price,
                x, 
                y, 
                z, 
                sd_thresh = 2)
```

**Exercise 2:** Write a function that imputes missing values for numeric 
variables in a dataset. The user should be able to supply the dataset, the 
variables to impute values for, and a function to use when imputing. 
*Hint 1: You will need to use `across()` to apply your function, since the user can input multiple variables.*
*Hint 2: The `replace_na()` function is helpful here!*

```{r}
#| label: exercise-2


```

## Testing Your Function! 

```{r}
#| label: exercise-2-test
#| error: true

## Testing how your function handles multiple input variables
impute_missing(nycflights13::flights, 
               arr_delay, 
               dep_delay) 

## Testing how your function handles an input that isn't numeric
impute_missing(nycflights13::flights, 
               arr_delay, 
               carrier)

## Testing how your function handles a non-default impute_fun
impute_missing(nycflights13::flights, 
               arr_delay, 
               dep_delay, 
               impute_fun = median)
```

# Primary Function

**Exercise 3:** Write a `fit_model()` function that fits a specified linear
regression model for a specified dataset. The function should:

- allow the user to specify if outliers should be removed (`TRUE` or `FALSE`)
- allow the user to specify if missing observations should be imputed
(`TRUE` or `FALSE`)

If either option is `TRUE`, your function should call your `remove_outliers()`
or `impute_missing()` functions to modify the data **before** the regression 
model is fit. 

```{r}
#| label: exercise-3


```

## Testing Your Function! 

```{r}
#| label: exercise-3-test

fit_model(
  diamonds,
  mod_formula = price ~ carat + cut,
  remove_outliers = TRUE,
  impute_missing = TRUE,
  price, 
  carat
)
```

# Iteration

In the `diamonds` dataset, we want to understand the relationship between
`price` and size (`carat`). We want to explore variation along two choices:

1. The variables included in the model. We'll explore 3 sets of variables:
    - No further variables (just `price` and `carat`)
    - Adjusting for `cut`
    - Adjusting for `cut` and `clarity`
    - Adjusting for `cut`, `clarity`, and `color`

2. Whether or not to impute missing values

3. Whether or not to remove outliers in the `carat` variable (we'll define
outliers as cases whose `carat` is over 3 SDs away from the mean).

## Parameters

First, we need to define the set of parameters we want to iterate the
`fit_model()` function over. The `tidyr` package has a useful function called
`crossing()` that is useful for generating argument combinations. For each
argument, we specify all possible values for that argument and `crossing()` 
generates all combinations. 
*Note that you can create a list of formula objects in R with `c(y ~ x1, y ~ x1 + x2)`.*

```{r}
#| label: example-crossing-arguments
#| eval: false

df_arg_combos <- crossing(
    impute = c(TRUE, FALSE),
    remove_outliers = c(TRUE, FALSE), 
    mod = c(y ~ x1, 
            y ~ x1 + x2)
)
df_arg_combos
```

**Exercise 4:** Use `crossing()` to create the data frame of argument
combinations for our analyses. 

```{r}
#| label: exercise-4

```

## Iterating Over the Parameters

We've arrived at the final step! 

**Exercise 5:** Use `pmap()` from `purrr` to apply the `fit_model()` function to
every combination of arguments from `diamonds.

```{r}
#| label: exercise-5


```
